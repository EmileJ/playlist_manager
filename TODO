GRAPHICAL:
 ☐ Better printing of the playlists when rapidly switching between them: store playlists in a list that doesn't change
 ☐ Manage messages concerning the amount of files copied, not copied, etc..
 ✔ Manage raised errors in the errorHandler function. Maybe a new param called "type" could be added to this one, desribing the type of error window to be opened (error, warning, ...) @done (17-07-07 00:53)
